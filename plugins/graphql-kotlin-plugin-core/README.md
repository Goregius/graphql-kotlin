Module containing common logic used by the GraphQL Kotlin Gradle and Maven plugins. **This module is not intended to be
consumed directly and instead you should rely on the provided build plugins.**

## Current functionality
* Download SDL from a target endpoint.
* Run introspection query against target endpoint and return underlying schema.
* Generate GraphQL Kotlin client code from the specified queries to be run against target GraphQL schema. 
  Code is generated using [square/kotlinpoet](https://github.com/square/kotlinpoet) library.

## Code Generation Limitations

* Currently only Ktor Http Client is supported. Additional clients (e.g. Spring WebClient) might be supported in the future.
* Due to the custom logic required for deserialization of polymorphic types and default enum values only Jackson is currently supported.
* Only a single operation per query file is supported.
* Subscriptions are currently not supported.
* You cannot make multiple selections to the same GraphQL object with different fields within a single GraphQL query. 
  But you can have different selection sets across different GraphQL queries.
* Anonymous operations are supported but will result in generic `AnonymousQuery` (for query operation) class. Plugins
  do not keep track of state across different query generations so if you have multiple anonymous operations in a single
  package your compilation will fail due to the generic class name collisions.
